One of the good games which I made, this has better graphics than most of my games. You can expect good changes anytime soon.

This is a classical 2048 game your target is to create the largest number possible which is 2048. I hope you will all like the game and also give a nice review. 

Rules of the game in case you didn't knew:-

The game concept is simple and complex at the same time. To the only rule of the game is that you have to merge 2 tiles with the same numerical value and then they become 1 tile with x2 of their original value then you have to merge this new x2 tile with another x2 tile until you reach 2048.

HOW TO PLAY:-

You can easily play this game just press all the arrow keys and you will understand it.
